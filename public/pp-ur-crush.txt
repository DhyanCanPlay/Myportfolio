Privacy Policy — “Ur Crush” Discord Bot

1. Data Collected
“Ur Crush” collects only the minimum data required for functionality:
• User IDs (for moderation logs, bans, warnings)
• Message content only when necessary for moderation commands (e.g., warn/log actions)
• Server IDs and configuration settings
• Voice channel IDs for music playback
No data outside Discord is collected.


2. How Data Is Used
• For processing moderation actions
• For music features
• For storing server preferences and settings
• To maintain bot functionality and stability


3. Data Storage
• Some data may be stored temporarily in memory.
• Long-term stored data (e.g., moderation logs or configs) is limited and only used within the server.
• Data is never shared, sold, or used for advertising.


4. Data Removal
Server administrators may request removal of stored configuration data or moderation logs.
Removing the bot from the server will prevent new data from being collected.


5. Third-Party Services
The bot operates entirely within Discord and does not use external third-party services for user data processing, except for music-related APIs that do not access personal info.


6. Security
Reasonable measures are taken to secure stored data, but perfect security cannot be guaranteed.


7. Children’s Privacy
The bot follows Discord’s age requirement (13+ or local equivalent). No additional child-specific data is collected.


8. Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of the bot means you accept the updated policy.
